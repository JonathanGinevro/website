			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>My name is Jonathan Ginevro, and I am a first-year computer science specialist at the University of Toronto. 
                Over the past 3 years, I have been working to improve my programming experience in languages such as Python, Java, HTML, and Swift.

			<h3>Work, Volunteer and Extracircular Experience</h3>
			<p>Within my high school community, I served as Prefect and Ambassador (2019-2020).

                I was also a member of the "Alive Outdoors" leadership program (2018-2020).

                Lastly, I was an active senior member of my school Drumline and Concert Band (2016-2020).

                Our drumline went on to become provincial champions for 3 straight years.

                Outside of school, I have trained to reach my black belt in karate (2012-2021).

                I have experience volunteering as an instructor for summer camps.

                I also play the piano and received my Grade 8 Honours from the RCM (2008-2021).

                I have experience working as a substitute teacher at a local music studio.

                Going forward, I hope to continue to expand on these activities and find further ways to get involved.
